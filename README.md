# Drawing-based-Image-Retrieval
In this project we have used Siamese Networks with Triplet Loss for Drawing based Image Retrieval. For detailed specifics please refer to the Detailed_Report.pdf file.
Majority of the work on this project project was done in Google Colab and therefore it only contains the final version on Github.
